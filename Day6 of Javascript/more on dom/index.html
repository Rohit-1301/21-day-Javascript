        Hi Everyone welcome to learn Dom in javascript with me
      </h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to our JavaScript DOM learning session! We'll explore how to
        interact with web pages dynamically using the Document Object Model
        (DOM). You'll learn how to manipulate HTML elements, handle events, and
        enhance user experience. Perfect for those looking to make their web
        pages more interactive and engaging!
      </p>
      <p>
        In this session, we'll cover essential DOM methods and properties.
        You'll discover how to select elements using getElementById,
        querySelector, and more. We'll also dive into event listeners to respond
        to user actions, making your web pages more responsive and interactive.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll practice by creating dynamic content and modifying styles
        on-the-fly. By the end, you'll be able to build web pages that adapt and
        respond to user interactions, enhancing the overall user experience.
        Join us and unlock the power of JavaScript in web development!
