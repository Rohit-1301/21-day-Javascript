/*
    there are total 5 primitive datatypes in javascript
    1.string 2.number 3.boolean 4.null 5.undefined
    Note:- we can check the type of any variable using typeof keyword
    also if we check the type of undefined then it will show undefined
    but iif we check the type of null then it will show object. It makes me surprise and also 
    it is very useful when we use to make a website .
