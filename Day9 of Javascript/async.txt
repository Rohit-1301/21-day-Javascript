1.Javascript is a synchronous language which means it will execute the code line by line.
2.Javascript is a single-threaded language which means it can only execute one line of code at a time.
3.Due to which it is a slow language compared to other languages like c,c++,java.

"Understanding Asynchronous JavaScript Fundamentals" provides a strong foundation for grasping the theoretical aspects
 of asynchronous code in JavaScript. It covers the single-threaded nature of JavaScript, the concept of blocking vs non-blocking code,
 and the importance of writing both types in JavaScript. The video also emphasizes key topics such as Web APIs,
 promises, execution context, setTimeout, setInterval, the flow of data in a stock system, and the usage of fetch and promises
 for asynchronous operations. Important points to note include the single-threaded nature of JavaScript, the distinction between 
 blocking and non-blocking code, the significance of Web APIs, and the use of promises and asynchronous operations for efficient 
 execution.By Understanding these concept we can write a code in a systematic manner/
